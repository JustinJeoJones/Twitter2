                        <p class="paragraph">You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. With practice comes confidence. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Use what you see, don't plan it. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Learn when to stop. There we are. Imagination is the key to painting. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.</p>
